# Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

This repository is a collection of my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects.  
The goal is to **practice, learn, and master EDA techniques** while applying different statistical tools and visualizations across various datasets.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
```

eda-projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md 
â””â”€â”€ e-commerce-eda/
    â”œâ”€â”€ notebook.ipynb
    â”œâ”€â”€ images/
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt

```

Each project lives in its own folder with:
- A Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis  
- An `images/` directory for plots  
- A project-specific `requirements.txt` and `README.md`

To install dependencies, use:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
